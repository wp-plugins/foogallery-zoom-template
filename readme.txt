== Description ==

A simple gallery with one really cool feature: ZOOM!

A custom template for FooGallery which allows your visitors to magnify your images with a magnifying glass-like effect.

Like other FooGallery templates you can customize the image size, border styles and shapes. With ZOOM! You can also customize the lens size, lens border, shadow depth. You can also set your thumbnails to have a grayscale or blurred effect either on load or on hover. Blur/grayscale only effects the thumbnail, so that when you look through the magnifying glass you still have a sharp, crisp, and full-color image magnified.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Where's the Documentation?
We'll have a detailed walkthrough of using ZOOM! at the [FooPlugins Documentation site](http://docs.fooplugins.com) soon.

2. Can I customize the look of the zoom with CSS?
Feel free, but just know that the CSS being used now is carefully crafted to make the zoom effect possible. Your custom styles could wreck it. That's why I built-in the border styles and lens size into the settings. I figured those were the things users would be most concerned with customizing.
